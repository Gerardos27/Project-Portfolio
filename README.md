# Project-Portfolio

Hello! My name is Gerardo Sandoval. I am an Information Science student at the University of Maryland with a concentration in Data Science. I have a strong passion for leveraging data to analyze trends, solve complex problems, and generate actionable insights.

Here are some of my featured projects, where I demonstrate my skills in Data Science, Object-Oriented Programming, web applications, and more. I hope you enjoy exploring them!

## Baseball Swing Speed Predictor
A Jupyter Notebook project predicting **athlete swing speed** using **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models. Data is retrieved from a SQL database, cleaned, filtered, and analyzed to identify which features best predict faster swing speeds.  
- **Skills Demonstrated:** SQL integration, Python data manipulation, machine learning, feature engineering, model evaluation, data visualization

## FanZone Highlights – Soccer Match Highlights Platform
A full-stack web application that aggregates soccer match highlight data using the Scorebat API and transforms it into an interactive, data-driven viewing experience. The application enables users to filter highlights by competition, explore match-level data through visualizations, and persist user-selected favorites in a Supabase backend database. This project emphasizes building a clean data pipeline from API ingestion to visualization and storage.
- ** Skills Demonstrated:** API data ingestion and transformation, JavaScript front-end development, data visualization, exploratory data analysis, backend data persistence (Supabase), full-stack application architecture

## Roll-for-Your-Life Video Game
A Python turn-based strategy game using **classes and inheritance**. Players roll a die to earn coins and purchase items from a store to attack or heal against an AI opponent.  
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Object-oriented programming, game logic, AI implementation
