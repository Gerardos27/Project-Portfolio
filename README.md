# Project-Portfolio

Hello! My name is Gerardo Sandoval. I am an Information Science student at the University of Maryland with a concentration in Data Science. I have a strong passion for leveraging data to analyze trends, solve complex problems, and generate actionable insights.

Here are some of my featured projects, where I demonstrate my skills in Data Science, Object-Oriented Programming, web applications, and more. I hope you enjoy exploring them!
